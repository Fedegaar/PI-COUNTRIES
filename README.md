## Project's goals
In this individual project at Henry I had the opportunity to apply everything I learned in these 5 months. It should be noted that in it we were not allowed to use libraries, everything had to be "pure". The idea was to create a SPA (Single Page Application) that shows me relevant information from approximately 250 countries. I got them from an API that Henry provided me. Likewise, this information was stored in a database, and from there it was manipulated, to show it or add tourist activities to each country.

## Learnings
I remember that when I started the project all my knowledge was "up in the air", so I was able to finish settling it, uniting everything I had learned.
I was able to reaffirm the knowledge, for example, Promises, Async/Await, React, Redux. As well as the same logic to be applied to show the tangible, which in this case would be the Activities by countries and the Countries themselves.

## Conclusion
Actually at this stage I was able to apply most of the technologies I learned.
Which is why I had a lot of fun doing it, and most of all, I enjoyed it!
It was just the beginning of what was to come!
